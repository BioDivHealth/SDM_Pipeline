# Overview
This repository includes the Auto_maxent function which is design to run (MaxEnt)[https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/] on an user friendly and mostly unsupervised way. `Auto_maxent()` is a wrapper of the `dismo::maxent` that allows for an easier access to MaxEnt internal parameters and adds multiple tools for data preparation, background sampling, model testing and evaluation, and model selection. In addition to `Auto_maxent()` this repository includes other functions that facilitate the pre-processing, data adquisition and filtering, as well as spatial data harmonization, needed to run any species distribution model. Many of these functions are integrated into Auto_maxent but can be found in the `Functions` folder. These functions can be run in isolation and offer more options than their Auto_maxent integrated versions. Therefore, in this script you will find mostly everything you need to run some SDMs.

## The Auto_maxent function:
`Auto_maxent()`has more than XX parameters that control different aspects of model background sampling, presence point selection, variable selection, and model fit. Despite the number of parameters, most of them can be run using their default values. Other parameters such as XX and XX can have a huge impact on model output and therfore some supervision and user imput is recommended. Overall we can group the Auto_maxent paramters into three groups:
